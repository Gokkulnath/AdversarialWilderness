I am 23 years old. I was born in the city of [Madurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madurai) in India. I lived in [Coimbatore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbatore) for four years while I was pursuing my undergraduate education.I have also lived in  Trichy, Vellore and Chennai during school days. Currently I stay in [Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore), Karnataka. I completed my undergraduate education in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/coimbatore) on May 2017.

I currently work as a Software Test Engineer, Testing Virtual Network Functions(VNF) and solve Cloud based challenges related to Telecom Industry at [Ericsson](https://ericsson.com/), Bangalore, Karnataka.

I am interested in Deep Learning and Computer Vision with specific focus on GANs, Adversarial Machine learning and Federated Learning. I am inclined towards working on projects that involve working on the intersection of these fields. I enjoy playing Table Tennis, Fixing Broken Electronics, Watching Movies and Programming.
