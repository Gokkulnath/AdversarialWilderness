I am 24 years old. I was born in the city of Madurai in India. I lived in Coimbatore for four years while pursuing my undergraduate education. I have also lived in Trichy, Vellore and Chennai during school days. Currently I stay in Bengaluru, Karnataka. I completed my undergraduate education in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore on May 2017.

I am interested in Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Data Analytics. I am inclined towards working on projects that involve working on the intersection of these fields. I enjoy playing Table Tennis, Fixing Broken Electronics, Watching Movies and Programming.

I currently work as a Software Development Engineer in Test at Ericsson, Bangalore, Karnataka. I am interested in Robust Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
