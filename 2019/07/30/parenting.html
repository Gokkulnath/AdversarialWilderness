<p>My kid :The weekend Standup</p>

<p>â€Œparenting has always been an unspoken topic especially among the Indian parents.
Indian parents usually go with what the society dictates and often ask there children to blindly follow those guidelines. For eg.. Many children are forced to  join engineering irrespective of their interests just because the society dictates that engineers are Great, well 
respected and well paid.
So today, I propose a concept wherein parents spend some time span every week understanding their kids interests and needs. The idea is to discuss with the kid regarding the highlights of activities that they have done in the entire week. When the child shares their views, watch them very closely. If you find a situation that the child could have handled in a better way, ask them why and what was the rationale behind when they had to act for a particular situation, suggest them what you would have done and the reason behind it. This one activity will prepare your kid for the real world. Though they lack maturity to understand the political drama that the society revolves around they will get to know how to handle their immediately circle and react with emotional intelligence.
Further, parents can also share their similar personal experience which can also enable the child to learn from parents experience.</p>
