<p>Object Detection in Retail Shops - The challenges</p>

<p>Interest on Activity monitoring in retail shops has been in the rise since the announcement of Amazon Go.
Last weekend I was at infliect a Computer vision based startup out of Bangalore which tries to solve the problem for a different reason.
The reason being  brands like PepsiCo for example need to understand how well the product sales are at all the retail outlets. They also need to ensure/validate that the retailers are displaying the products as per the service level agreement. That usually states that the shelf space at a retail shop must be more or less equal to the market share the brand has on the entire market.
We had three very informative sessions from the team working on this problem at infliect.
Confusion matrix on the bounding box labels was a new idea that was discussed. This way of inspecting the model gives us a better understanding of the failure cases. Unlike traditional metrics like mAP which gives only the quantitative aspect of error and fails to provide explanation on how the failures are associated among the bounding box</p>
